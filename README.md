This repository includes the scripts and data that was used for generating the "Caribbean Custom Scenery". data/SRTM-1 and the work*/ folders are not included for file size reasons, but they can be generated using the scripts given here.

### Following sources have been used:

* SRTM-1 global elevation data from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/ partially edited
* Landcover Data from https://www.openstreetmap.org/export and https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html under ODbL 1.0
* Airport Data from https://gateway.x-plane.com

Thanks to _laserman_ for scripts to process airport data files into groundnets (https://github.com/mherweg/d-laser-fgtools)!  
A huge thanks goes to _SurferTim_ via the FlightGear forums (forum.flightgear.org) for a tool to edit HGT files (https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=36077&start=90#p359458) and his work on editing the HGT file including TFFJ to fit real life data and imagery.
